# Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
Bresenham's line algorithm is an algorithm that finds all the intermediate points required to draw a complete line from 
A(x1, y1) -> B(x2,y2) onto a computer screen of pixels. This algorithm was created to display lines from an FPGA onto a computer monitor through VGA output.
